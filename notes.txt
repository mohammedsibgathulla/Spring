1. Quick Introduction to Spring Framework
Dependency Injection solves the problem of tight coupling of code.
@Component - Spring manages the instances of the classes using the @Component.
@Autowired - Spring will autowire the dependency and populate it.

Important Terminology of Spring Framework
1. Beans - Differenct objects managed by spring framework.
2. Autowiring - Process where spring identifies the dependencies and identifies the matches for the dependencies and populates them.
3. Dependency Injection - Dependency Injection solves the problem of tight coupling of code and we don't need to instantiate the classes.
4. Inversion of Control - We are taking the control from the class which needs the dependency and giving the control to the spring framework.
5. IOC Container - It is a generic terminology to represent anything that is implementing IOC.
6. Application Context - In Spring Application Context is the IOC Container.

2. Setting Up Spring Boot Project Using http://start.spring.io
1. Just download the basic spring boot project without any dependencies.

3. Understanding the tight coupling.
- See the project.

4. Using Spring Framework To Manage Dependencies - @Component, @Autowired
- @springBootApplication tells spring to scan the package and subpackages in which it is declared.
